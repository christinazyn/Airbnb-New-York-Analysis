# Overview
Airbnb has emerged as a progressively favored accommodation choice for travelers, thanks to the burgeoning sharing economy. New York City, being a highly developed tourist destination, boasts an extensive inventory of Airbnb properties. Exploring the distribution, characteristics, and connections of Airbnb in the context of New York City presents intriguing research opportunities. Thus, this project delves into two datasets: the Airbnb dataset and the demographic data of New York City, examining them from a geospatial perspective.

# Research Question 
1. How are Airbnbs distributed in NYC?
2. What is the relationship within and between the demographic features and the airbnb features?
3. What are the spatial relationships of the demographic features and the airbnb features with Borough?
