## Project Overview

Airbnb has become a popular choice for travelers, thanks to the growing sharing economy. New York City, being a highly developed tourist destination, boasts an extensive inventory of Airbnb properties. Exploring the distribution, characteristics, and connections of Airbnb in the context of New York City presents intriguing research opportunities. Thus, this project delved into two datasets: the Airbnb dataset and the demographic data of New York City, examining them from a geospatial perspective.

## Data Analysis

### Data Source

- [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)
- [GeoDa Data and lab](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/)

Since this project was completed in 2021, I have used the 2021 Airbnb data. Right now, the dataset has archived in the Inside Airbnb website, but you can find it in this reporsitory or make an archived data request on their website.

### Data Acuqiztion/Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Scraped the data by URL
2. Described and visualized the data
3. Cleaned the data by dropping unrelated variables, converted data type and did some data transformations.

### Data Analysis

This part involved exploring the Airbnb data to answer some key questions, such as:

- How are Airbnb listings distributed in NYC?
- What is the relationship within and between demographic features and Airbnb listings?
- What are the spatial relationships of demographic features and Airbnb listings within Boroughs?

### Insights

The analysis uncovered significant correlations between economic conditions and education levels, emphasizing the influence of education on citizens' financial well-being. In terms of Airbnb, Manhattan led with the highest prices, while Brooklyn followed closely due to its diverse offerings. Spatial relationships among boroughs showed clustering of demographic features within each borough, indicating interconnectedness.
