## Project Overview

---

Airbnb has emerged as a progressively favored accommodation choice for travelers, thanks to the burgeoning sharing economy. New York City, being a highly developed tourist destination, boasts an extensive inventory of Airbnb properties. Exploring the distribution, characteristics, and connections of Airbnb in the context of New York City presents intriguing research opportunities. Thus, this project delves into two datasets: the Airbnb dataset and the demographic data of New York City, examining them from a geospatial perspective.

## Data Analysis

### Data Source

- [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)
- [GeoDa Data and lab](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/)

Since this project completed in 2021, I have used the 2021 Airbnb data. It has archived in the Inside Airbnb website, but you can find it in this reporsitory or make an archived data request on their website.

### Data Acuqiztion/Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Scape the data by url
2. Describe and visualize the data
3. Clean the data by dropping unrelated variables, convert data type and do some data transformation (joins).

### Data Analysis

Data analysis involved exploring the Airbnb data to answer key questions, such as:

- How are Airbnb listings distributed in NYC?
- What is the relationship within and between demographic features and Airbnb listings?
- What are the spatial relationships of demographic features and Airbnb listings within Boroughs?

### Insights

The analysis reveals strong correlations between economic conditions and education levels, highlighting the impact of education on citizens' financial well-being. In terms of Airbnb, Manhattan leads with the highest prices, while Brooklyn follows closely due to its diverse offerings. Spatial relationships among boroughs show clustering of demographic features within each borough, indicating interconnectedness.
