# Overview
Airbnb has become an increasingly popular choice of accommodations for those travelling due to the growth of the sharing economy. New York, as a touristy developed city, owns a great number of Airbnb housings. The distribution, characteristics and link of Airbnb in New York City with other features are all interesting issues to investigate. In this perspective, we will study two datasets in this project: the Airbnb dataset and the New York City demography dataset.

We start by scarping these two datasets from the website 'Inside Airbnb' and 'GeoDa Data and Lab' respectively. The 'Inside Airbnb' website periodically publishes snapshots of Airbnb lisitngs around the world. We use the detailed listings data for New York City. The raw dataset describes 37714 observations and 74 variables and was collected between 2021 April to November. The NYC demography dataset contains 195 obserations and 98 variables. The dataset is collected from American Community Survey (ACS) by U.S. Census Bureau. It contains the demographic information for New York City neighborhoods at the NTA level from 2008 to 2012.

# Research Question 
1. How are Airbnbs distributed in NYC?
2. What is the relationship within and between the demographic features and the airbnb features?
3. What are the spatial relationships of the demographic features and the airbnb features with Borough?
