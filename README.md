# Overview
Airbnb has become an increasingly popular choice of accommodations for those travelling due to the growth of the sharing economy. New York, as a touristy developed city, owns a great number of Airbnb housings. The distribution, characteristics and link of Airbnb in New York City with other features are all interesting issues to investigate. In this perspective,this project studies two datasets: the Airbnb dataset and the New York City demography dataset.

# Research Question 
1. How are Airbnbs distributed in NYC?
2. What is the relationship within and between the demographic features and the airbnb features?
3. What are the spatial relationships of the demographic features and the airbnb features with Borough?
